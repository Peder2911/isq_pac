Code for producing tables and plots for an upcoming paper.

The data needed, and the results should be checked against checksums included
in the checklist.chk files. This ensures that the results are correct (or at
least consistent :smile:). 

Depends on [evallib](http://github.com/peder2911/evallib).

The data folder must, in addition to other data sources, also contain a database which is generated by the code from [this repository](http://github.com/peder2911/isq_pac_database)
